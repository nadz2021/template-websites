	                            <p>In the past, authors believed that they should never have to pay in order to have their work published. However, the face of publishing has changed. It is becoming increasingly difficult to get noticed by traditional publishing houses, and as a result, many compelling stories have been left untold.</p>
	                            <p>The self-publishing industry has revolutionised the world of publishing and opened up a whole new array of options for writers. You no longer have to wait to be recognised by a publisher or agent to see your work in print. You now have the full power to become a published author with a finished, professional book available to your readers --, no matter who they are, where in the world they live, and when they want to order. Publication is no longer just for the selected few. It is now an exciting goal that everyone can attain. Self-publishing has placed the power to publish in your hands.</p>
